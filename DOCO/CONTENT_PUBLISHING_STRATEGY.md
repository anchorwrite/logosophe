# Content Publishing Platform - Strategy & Implementation Plan

## Vision Summary

**Core Concept:** Transform Logosophe from a workflow collaboration tool into a comprehensive content publishing platform where:
- **Content creators** (authors, editors, agents) collaborate via workflows
- **Publishers** control what gets published to subscribers
- **Subscribers** consume protected content with interaction capabilities
- **Non-subscribers** can view content but cannot interact
- **Admins** maintain oversight and control

## Architecture Overview

### User Hierarchy
```
Credentials Users (admin/tenant) → Full system access
Authors/Editors/Agents → Create content via workflows
Publishers → Control publishing decisions
Subscribers → Consume + interact with content
Non-subscribers → Consume content only
```

### Content Flow
```
Workflow Collaboration → Publishing Decision → Protected Content → Subscriber Access
```

### Tenant Architecture
- **User Tenants** (default, test-tenant-1, etc.): Where users create and manage content
- **Content Tenant** (content): Backend-only tenant for published content accessible to subscribers
- **Publishing Process**: Files added to content tenant when published, removed when unpublished
- **Security**: Publishers never see content tenant in UI, only their own tenants

## Database Schema Strategy

### New Tables Required
```sql
-- Content publishing
PublishedContent (Id, MediaId, PublisherId, PublishedAt, PublishingSettings, ApprovalStatus, AccessToken)

-- Token-based access (public publishing)
PublishedContentTokens (Id, PublishedContentId, AccessToken, CreatedAt, ExpiresAt, IsActive)

-- Content categorization
Form (Id, Name, Description) -- poetry, novel, short story, etc.
Genre (Id, Name, Description) -- literary, science fiction, romance, etc.

-- Content metadata
ContentMetadata (Id, ContentId, Genre, Tags, TargetAudience, Description)

-- Comment system
ContentComments (Id, ContentId, AuthorEmail, Content, CreatedAt, Status, ModeratedBy)

-- Analytics tracking
ContentUsage (Id, ContentId, UserEmail, UsageType, UsageData, IpAddress, UserAgent, CreatedAt)

-- Future monetization: Per-user purchase tokens
UserContentTokens (Id, UserEmail, MediaId, PurchaseToken, PurchasedAt, ExpiresAt, IsActive)
```

### Enhanced Tables
```sql
-- Add publisher role
INSERT INTO Roles (Id, Name, Description) VALUES ('publisher', 'Publisher', 'Can publish content to subscribers');

-- Add publishing permissions
INSERT INTO Permissions (Id, Name, Description, Resource, Action) VALUES
('content.publish', 'Publish Content', 'Can publish content to subscribers', 'content', 'publish'),
('content.unpublish', 'Unpublish Content', 'Can remove content from public access', 'content', 'unpublish'),
('content.manage_protection', 'Manage Protection', 'Can set content protection settings', 'content', 'manage_protection'),
('comments.moderate', 'Moderate Comments', 'Can approve/reject comments', 'comments', 'moderate'),
('analytics.view', 'View Analytics', 'Can view content analytics', 'analytics', 'view');

-- Remove routes permissions (as discussed)
DELETE FROM Permissions WHERE Resource = 'routes';
DELETE FROM RolePermissions WHERE PermissionId IN (SELECT Id FROM Permissions WHERE Resource = 'routes');
```

## Token-Based Access Architecture

### Current Implementation: Public Publishing Tokens
- **One token per published content**: Each published media file gets a unique access token
- **Public access**: Anyone with the token can access the content
- **User type detection**: Protection applied based on session (unauthenticated, authenticated non-subscriber, subscriber)
- **Token generation**: Auto-generated when content is published using `nanoid(32)` for Edge Runtime compatibility
- **Token cleanup**: Automatically removed when content is unpublished
- **URL format**: `/content/[token]/view` for public access

### Future Implementation: Per-User Purchase Tokens
- **One token per user per purchased content**: Each user gets a unique token for each purchased media file
- **Monetization support**: Enables paid downloads and premium content access
- **User-specific access**: Tokens tied to specific user accounts
- **Purchase tracking**: Track what content each user has purchased
- **Expiration support**: Tokens can expire based on subscription or purchase terms
- **URL format**: `/content/purchased/[token]/view` for purchased content

### Token Architecture Benefits
- **Security**: Prevents guessing of content URLs
- **Access control**: Granular control over who can access what
- **Analytics**: Track access patterns and user behavior
- **Monetization ready**: Foundation for paid content features
- **Scalability**: Supports both public and private content distribution

### ContentUsage Analytics Design
- **Flexible tracking**: Single table handles multiple interaction types (view, download, favorite, comment, rating, share)
- **Anonymous support**: UserEmail can be NULL for anonymous users
- **Rich metadata**: UsageData JSON field stores interaction-specific data (rating values, comment text, etc.)
- **Performance optimized**: Indexed on ContentId, UserEmail, UsageType, and CreatedAt
- **Future-ready**: Easy to add new interaction types without schema changes
- **Analytics accuracy**: Dashboard actions use `noLog=true` parameter to prevent inflated counts

## API Structure

### Content Management
```
/api/harbor/media/* - Content creation and management (existing)
/api/harbor/content/* - Content consumption and interaction (new)
```

### Token-Based Access
```
GET /api/content/[token]/view - Public content viewer (current)
GET /api/content/purchased/[token]/view - Purchased content viewer (future)
POST /api/content/[token]/purchase - Purchase content (future)
GET /api/content/user/purchases - List user's purchased content (future)
```

### Publishing Workflow
```
POST /api/harbor/media/[id]/publish - Publisher publishes content (generates token)
DELETE /api/harbor/media/[id]/publish - Publisher unpublishes content (removes token)
PUT /api/harbor/media/[id]/publish-settings - Update protection settings
GET /api/content - List published content (public access)
GET /api/content/[token]/view - Protected content viewer
GET /api/content/[token]/download - Download content (with protection)
GET /api/content/[token]/preview - Preview content in browser
POST /api/content/[token]/comment - Add comment (subscribers only)
GET /api/harbor/content - Subscriber content dashboard
GET /api/harbor/content/analytics - Get analytics (admin/owner only)
```

## Content Protection Strategy

### Technical Implementation
- **Watermarking**: Server-side generation for images/documents, client-side overlay for all content
- **Copy Protection**: Disable text selection, right-click, keyboard shortcuts
- **Screenshot Prevention**: CSS + JavaScript protection
- **Download Control**: Selective download permissions based on user role
- **Bot Protection**: Rate limiting, user agent validation, CAPTCHA for high-value content

### Protection Levels
- **Basic**: Watermark + copy protection
- **Enhanced**: Screenshot prevention + download restrictions
- **Premium**: Advanced DRM (future)

## Workflow Integration Strategy

### Enhanced Workflow States
```
active → completed → published (new state)
active → completed → archived (not published)
```

### Publishing Integration
- Workflow completion triggers publishing decision point
- Publishers can review and approve content from workflows
- Published content maintains workflow history reference
- Quality assurance through collaboration before publishing

- **German** (de) - German translations
- **Spanish** (es) - Spanish translations  
- **French** (fr) - French translations
- **Dutch** (nl) - Dutch translations

### i18n Implementation Strategy

**Translation Files:**
- All publishing UI components require translations in `/locales/[lang]/translation.json`
- Content metadata (titles, descriptions) should support multiple languages
- System messages and notifications must be internationalized
- Error messages and validation text need translations

**Content Localization:**
- Published content can have language-specific versions
- Content discovery should respect user's language preference
- Search and filtering should work across languages
- Analytics should track language-specific engagement

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use existing `useTranslation` hook from react-i18next
- Follow existing translation patterns in harbor components
- Maintain consistent translation keys across publishing features
- Support language switching in content discovery interface

**Translation Keys Needed:**
```json
{
  "publishing": {
    "publish": "Publish",
    "unpublish": "Unpublish", 
    "publishSettings": "Publishing Settings",
    "protectionSettings": "Protection Settings",
    "watermark": "Add Watermark",
    "disableCopy": "Disable Copy",
    "disableDownload": "Disable Download",
    "publishedContent": "Published Content",
    "contentDiscovery": "Content Discovery",
    "featuredContent": "Featured Content",
    "bookOfWeek": "Book of the Week",
    "topContent": "Top Content",
    "comments": "Comments",
    "moderateComments": "Moderate Comments",
    "analytics": "Analytics"
  },
  "content": {
    "view": "View",
    "download": "Download",
    "details": "Details",
    "totalViews": "Total Views",
    "totalDownloads": "Total Downloads",
    "recentViews": "Recent Views",
    "recentDownloads": "Recent Downloads"
  },
  "harbor": {
    "contentDashboard": "Content Dashboard"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Current System Compatibility
- Existing Permissions/RolePermissions tables are perfect for this vision
- Current workflow system provides excellent foundation for collaboration
- MediaLibrary component ready for publishing integration
- Access control patterns in .cursorules support new permissions
- Existing i18n infrastructure supports publishing features

### Migration Strategy
- Add new roles/permissions without breaking existing functionality
- Implement publishing features alongside existing media management
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Gradual rollout of new features

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all new API endpoints
- Integration tests for publishing workflow
- Security testing for content protection
- Performance testing under load
- User acceptance testing with real content creators

### Technical Learnings from Phase 1
- **Tenant Architecture**: Dedicated `content` tenant for publishing provides clean separation
- **Role Consistency**: API returns role IDs (`publisher`) and frontend checks for lowercase role IDs
- **Foreign Key Handling**: PublishedContent table requires careful FK constraint design
- **UI Isolation**: Content tenant should never appear in user-facing interfaces
- **Permission Model**: Publishers can publish from any tenant they have access to

### Technical Learnings from Phase 2
- **Token Architecture**: Token-based access provides security and flexibility for both public and future private content
- **User Type Detection**: Session-based detection enables protection differentiation without requiring authentication
- **URL Structure**: Token-based URLs prevent content guessing while maintaining clean URLs
- **Database Design**: Separate token tables allow for future expansion to per-user tokens
- **Edge Runtime**: All new content endpoints configured for Cloudflare Pages Edge Runtime
- **Internationalization**: Content viewer and listing components fully internationalized
- **Analytics Accuracy**: Dashboard actions must use `noLog=true` parameter to prevent inflated counts
- **OAuth Configuration**: Development environment requires proper `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` binding
- **Type Safety**: Edge Runtime requires explicit type assertions for database results
- **Component Architecture**: Radix UI/Themes components require specific prop patterns
- **File Serving**: R2 storage integration requires proper Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers
- **Navigation Integration**: Main page content blocks provide better UX than separate pages

This phased approach ensures steady progress while maintaining system stability and user experience quality. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a robust and scalable content publishing platform.

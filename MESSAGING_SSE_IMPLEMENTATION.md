# Messaging SSE Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to upgrade the user-facing messaging feature in the Harbor interface to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time message updates without requiring browser refreshes. This functionality is separate from the Harbor Workflow messaging, which is out of scope for this plan but can be used as a model.

**NEW REQUIREMENTS ADDED:**
- **File Attachments**: Support for attaching one or more files from the media library or uploading from desktop
- Use existing R2 storage bucket by leveraging the Harbor Media Library feature (do not change this feature, but leverage it as-is for file handling).
- **Link Sharing**: Ability to paste and share clickable internet links in message bodies

## Current Architecture
The messaging system currently uses a traditional request-response pattern:
- Messages are sent via POST to `/api/harbor/messaging/send` (subscribers) or `/api/dashboard/messaging/send` (admins)
- Messages are retrieved via GET from `/api/harbor/messaging/messages` (subscribers) or `/api/dashboard/messaging/messages` (admins)
- UI components manually refresh or poll for updates
- No real-time updates are available
- **Current Limitations**: No file attachment support, no link sharing capabilities

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Subscribers accessing `/[lang]/harbor/messaging`
- **Scope**: Tenant-scoped messaging within the harbor interface
- **Excluded**: Admin dashboard messaging management (remains request-response)

## SSE Implementation Plan

### 1. Core SSE Infrastructure

#### 1.1 SSE Endpoint Creation
- **Endpoint**: `/api/harbor/messaging/stream/[tenantId]/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Establish persistent SSE connections for real-time message updates
- **Security**: Tenant-scoped, user authentication required
- **Pattern**: Follow existing workflow SSE implementation in `/api/workflow/[id]/stream/route.ts`

#### 1.2 Connection Management
- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensure connections are properly scoped to user's tenant
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Handle connection establishment, maintenance, and cleanup

### 2. Event Broadcasting System

#### 2.1 Event Types
- `message:new` - New message received by user
- `message:read` - Message marked as read by user
- `message:delete` - Message deleted (if user has access)
- `message:update` - Message content updated
- `message:attachment:added` - File attachment added to message
- `message:attachment:removed` - File attachment removed from message

#### 2.2 Broadcasting Triggers
- **Message Send**: Broadcast `message:new` when `/api/harbor/messaging/send` is called
- **Read Status**: Broadcast `message:read` when marking messages as read
- **Message Actions**: Broadcast appropriate events for delete/update operations
- **File Attachments**: Broadcast `message:attachment:added` when files are attached

#### 2.3 Event Payload Structure
```typescript
interface MessageEvent {
  type: 'message:new' | 'message:read' | 'message:delete' | 'message:update' | 'message:attachment:added' | 'message:attachment:removed';
  data: {
    messageId: number;
    tenantId: string;
    timestamp: string;
    payload: any; // Event-specific data
  };
}
```

### 3. File Attachment System

#### 3.1 Database Schema Updates
**New Table: MessageAttachments**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MessageAttachments (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    MessageId INTEGER NOT NULL,
    MediaFileId INTEGER NOT NULL,
    AttachmentType TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'media_library' CHECK (AttachmentType IN ('media_library', 'upload')),
    FileName TEXT NOT NULL,
    FileSize INTEGER NOT NULL,
    ContentType TEXT NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (MessageId) REFERENCES Messages(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (MediaFileId) REFERENCES MediaFiles(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Update Messages Table**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Messages ADD COLUMN HasAttachments BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE Messages ADD COLUMN AttachmentCount INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

#### 3.2 File Attachment API Endpoints
- **POST** `/api/harbor/messaging/attachments/upload` - Upload new files from desktop
- **POST** `/api/harbor/messaging/attachments/attach` - Attach existing media library files
- **DELETE** `/api/harbor/messaging/attachments/[id]` - Remove attachment from message
- **GET** `/api/harbor/messaging/attachments/[messageId]` - Get attachments for a message

#### 3.3 File Attachment Types
- **Media Library Files**: Select from existing files in user's media library
- **Desktop Uploads**: Upload new files directly from user's device
- **Combined Approach**: Support mixing both types in single message
- **File Validation**: Size limits, type restrictions, virus scanning
- **Access Control**: Ensure user has permission to access attached files

#### 3.4 File Attachment UI Components
- **MediaFileSelector**: Reuse existing component from workflow messaging
- **FileUploadZone**: Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- **AttachmentPreview**: Thumbnail previews for attached files
- **AttachmentList**: Manage multiple attachments per message
- **FileTypeIcons**: Visual indicators for different file types

### 4. Link Sharing System

#### 4.1 Link Detection and Processing
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detect URLs in message text
- **Link Validation**: Verify link format and accessibility
- **Link Preview**: Generate preview metadata (title, description, thumbnail)
- **Security**: Sanitize links to prevent XSS and malicious content

#### 4.2 Link Storage and Display
**New Table: MessageLinks**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MessageLinks (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    MessageId INTEGER NOT NULL,
    Url TEXT NOT NULL,
    Title TEXT,
    Description TEXT,
    ThumbnailUrl TEXT,
    Domain TEXT,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (MessageId) REFERENCES Messages(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### 4.3 Link Processing API
- **POST** `/api/harbor/messaging/links/process` - Process and validate links
- **GET** `/api/harbor/messaging/links/preview` - Get link preview metadata
- **Link Preview Service**: External service for fetching link metadata

#### 4.4 Link Display Features
- **Clickable Links**: Convert URLs to clickable links in message display
- **Link Previews**: Show rich previews with title, description, and thumbnail
- **Domain Display**: Show source domain for security awareness
- **Link Safety**: Visual indicators for safe/unsafe links

### 5. Client-Side Integration

#### 5.1 SSE Client Implementation
- **Component**: Update `SubscriberMessagingInterface.tsx`
- **Connection**: Replace manual refresh/polling with EventSource
- **Reconnection**: Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to existing behavior on connection failures

#### 5.2 Real-Time UI Updates
- **Message List**: Automatically update message list when new messages arrive
- **Read Status**: Update message badges and styling in real-time
- **Statistics**: Update message counts and stats automatically
- **Notifications**: Show real-time feedback for message actions

- **Link Processing**: Real-time link validation and preview
- **Message Validation**: Enhanced validation for attachments and links
- **Progress Indicators**: Upload progress and processing status

### 6. Harbor Appbar Integration

#### 6.1 Unread Message Indicator
- **Location**: Add messaging navigation item to harbor appbar with unread count badge
- **API Endpoint**: Create `/api/harbor/messaging/unread-count/route.ts` for fetching unread count
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use SSE to update unread count badge in real-time
- **Navigation**: Link directly to messaging interface from appbar

#### 6.2 Indicator Behavior
- **Display**: Show unread message count as a badge on the messaging navigation item
- **Auto-Clear**: Badge clears when user visits messaging page or when all messages are read
- **Real-Time**: Count updates automatically via SSE when new messages arrive
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if SSE unavailable (fallback to periodic polling)

#### 6.3 Implementation Details
- **Custom Hook**: Create `useUnreadMessageCount` hook for state management
- **Appbar Update**: Modify `/[lang]/harbor/appbar.tsx` to include messaging navigation
- **Badge Component**: Create reusable unread count badge component
- **State Synchronization**: Ensure appbar indicator stays in sync with messaging interface

### 7. Security & Performance

#### 7.1 Security Measures
- **Authentication**: Verify user session on SSE connection
- **Tenant Scoping**: Ensure users only receive events from their tenant unless a message is being sent by a global admin, in which case the sender can choose 1, some, or all tenants (e.g. for broadcast messages)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of SSE endpoints
- **Connection Validation**: Verify user permissions on connection establishment
- **File Security**: Validate file types, scan for malware, enforce size limits which are settable by a global or tenant admin in the dashboard/messaging code (future development)
- **Link Security**: Sanitize URLs, prevent XSS, validate external links

#### 7.2 Performance Optimizations
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficiently manage multiple user connections
- **Event Batching**: Group multiple updates into single events where possible
- **Selective Broadcasting**: Only send relevant events to each user
- **Connection Cleanup**: Remove inactive connections to free resources
- **File Processing**: Asynchronous file upload and processing
- **Link Caching**: Cache link previews to reduce external API calls

**Key Learnings & Database Schema Discovery**:
- **Actual Database Schema**: Queried database using `yarn wrangler d1 execute logosophe --command "PRAGMA table_info(table_name);"` instead of making assumptions
- **Messages Table**: Contains `Id`, `Subject`, `Body`, `SenderEmail`, `TenantId`, `MessageType`, `Priority`, `CreatedAt`, `ExpiresAt`, `IsDeleted`, `IsRecalled`, `RecalledAt`, `RecallReason`, `IsArchived`, `ArchivedAt`, `DeletedAt`, `HasAttachments`, `AttachmentCount`
- **MessageAttachments Table**: Uses `MediaId` (not `MediaFileId`) to link to MediaFiles, contains `Id`, `MessageId`, `MediaId`, `CreatedAt`, `AttachmentType`, `FileName`, `FileSize`, `ContentType`
- **MediaFiles Table**: Uses `R2Key` (not `FileKey`) for storage reference, contains `Id`, `FileName`, `FileSize`, `ContentType`, `MediaType`, `R2Key`, `UploadDate`, `UploadedBy`, `Description`, `Metadata`, `Duration`, `Width`, `Height`, `IsDeleted`, `DeletedAt`, `DeletedBy`, `Language`
- **MessageLinks Table**: Simple structure with `Id`, `MessageId`, `Url`, `Title`, `Description`, `ThumbnailUrl`, `Domain`, `CreatedAt`
- **MessageRecipients Table**: No `TenantId` column - tenant context comes from Messages table

**Components Created**:
- `messaging-events-broadcaster.ts` - Separate SSE broadcasting functions to avoid Next.js route export conflicts
- Updated all messaging API routes to use correct database schema

5. Documentation and deployment preparation

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Cloudflare Workers (already in use)
- D1 Database (already in use)
- SSE for connection management
- Existing authentication and authorization systems
- File upload and processing capabilities using Harbor Media Library (not Dashboard Media Library, which is a separate function)
- Link preview and metadata services

### Database Schema Verification (CRITICAL)
**IMPORTANT**: Always verify actual database schema using wrangler commands instead of making assumptions:
- **Check table structure**: `yarn wrangler d1 execute logosophe --command "PRAGMA table_info(table_name);"`
- **Execute on local**: `yarn wrangler d1 execute logosophe --command "SQL"`
- **Execute on remote**: `yarn wrangler d1 execute logosophe --remote --command "SQL"`

**Why This Matters**:
- Migration files may be out of sync with actual schema
- Column names and types can differ from assumptions
- Table relationships may not match expected structure
- Foreign key constraints and indexes may have changed
- Direct database queries reveal the true current state

### Message Deletion System Architecture
**Critical System Design for User Privacy and Data Control**

The messaging system implements a sophisticated **soft deletion architecture** that provides multiple levels of message control while maintaining data integrity and audit trails.

#### **Core Deletion Tables and Fields**
```sql
-- Messages table: Global message deletion
Messages.IsDeleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
Messages.DeletedAt DATETIME

-- MessageRecipients table: User-specific message deletion
MessageRecipients.IsDeleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE  
MessageRecipients.DeletedAt DATETIME
```

#### **Deletion Logic Implementation**
**Sender Deletion (Global)**: When a message sender deletes a message, it's removed for everyone
**Recipient Deletion (User-Specific)**: When a recipient deletes a message, it's only hidden from their view

#### **SSE Integration Requirements**
- **Query Filtering**: All SSE polling queries must filter both deletion flags
- **Real-Time Updates**: Deleted messages must immediately disappear from SSE streams
- **User Isolation**: Each user's SSE stream must respect their individual deletion preferences
- **Performance**: Deletion filtering must not impact SSE performance

#### **Security and Compliance Requirements**
- **Audit Trail**: All deletions must be logged with timestamps and user information
- **Data Retention**: Deleted messages remain in database for compliance purposes
- **Access Control**: Users can only delete messages they have access to
- **Tenant Isolation**: Deletion operations must respect tenant boundaries

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with EventSource support
- File upload and drag-and-drop support
- Graceful fallback for older browsers
- Mobile device compatibility

### Scalability Considerations
- Support for multiple concurrent users per tenant
- Efficient memory usage for connection management
- File storage and processing scalability
- Link preview service performance
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

## API Route Reorganization ✅ COMPLETED

### New API Structure
The messaging system has been reorganized to provide clear separation between harbor (subscriber) and dashboard (admin) functionality:

**Harbor Messaging APIs** (`/api/harbor/messaging/*`):
- `/api/harbor/messaging/send` - Send messages (subscribers)
- `/api/harbor/messaging/stream/[tenantId]` - SSE streaming
- `/api/harbor/messaging/unread-count` - Unread message count
- `/api/harbor/messaging/attachments/*` - File attachment management
- `/api/harbor/messaging/links/*` - Link sharing functionality
- `/api/harbor/messaging/messages/[id]` - Individual message operations

**Dashboard Messaging APIs** (`/api/dashboard/messaging/*`):
- `/api/dashboard/messaging/send` - Send messages (admins)
- `/api/dashboard/messaging/messages/[id]` - Message management (admins)
- `/api/dashboard/messaging/blocks/*` - User blocking management
- `/api/dashboard/messaging/recipients` - Recipient management
- `/api/dashboard/messaging/system` - System controls
- `/api/dashboard/messaging/route.ts` - Dashboard statistics

### Benefits of Reorganization
- **Clear Separation**: Harbor and dashboard functionality are completely separate
- **No Route Conflicts**: Each interface has its own API namespace
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend each interface independently
- **Security**: Clear access control boundaries between subscriber and admin APIs

- Column names may differ from expectations
- Table relationships may have changed
- Foreign key constraints may be different
- Data types may not match assumptions

### Message Deletion System Architecture
**Understanding How Message Deletion Works in the System**

The messaging system uses a **soft deletion approach** with **user-specific visibility control** that provides sophisticated privacy and control features.

#### **Database Structure for Deletion**
- **`Messages.IsDeleted`** - Marks if the entire message is deleted globally
- **`MessageRecipients.IsDeleted`** - Marks if a specific recipient's view of the message is deleted
- **`DeletedAt`** - Timestamp when deletion occurred for audit purposes

#### **Deletion Logic and Behavior**

**When a Sender Deletes a Message:**
```sql
-- Delete the entire message globally
UPDATE Messages SET IsDeleted = TRUE, DeletedAt = ? WHERE Id = ?

-- Delete ALL recipient records for this message
UPDATE MessageRecipients SET IsDeleted = TRUE, DeletedAt = ? WHERE MessageId = ?
```
**Result**: Message disappears for **everyone** (sender + all recipients)

**When a Recipient Deletes a Message:**
```sql
-- Only delete THIS recipient's view of the message
UPDATE MessageRecipients 
SET IsDeleted = TRUE, DeletedAt = ? 
WHERE MessageId = ? AND RecipientEmail = ?
```
**Result**: Message disappears **only for that recipient**, but remains visible to the sender and other recipients

#### **Real-World Example**
Let's say User A sends a message to Users B and C:

```
Message: "Hello everyone!"
- Sender: User A
- Recipients: User B, User C
```

**Scenario 1: User B deletes the message**
- **User A** (sender): Still sees "Hello everyone!" ✅
- **User B** (deleted): No longer sees the message ❌
- **User C**: Still sees "Hello everyone!" ✅

**Scenario 2: User A (sender) deletes the message**
- **User A** (sender): No longer sees the message ❌
- **User B**: No longer sees the message ❌
- **User C**: No longer sees the message ❌

#### **SSE Polling and Deletion Handling**
The SSE system respects both deletion flags to ensure proper message visibility:

```sql
-- Only shows messages that are NOT deleted globally
WHERE m.IsDeleted = FALSE

-- Only shows messages to recipients who haven't deleted them
LEFT JOIN MessageRecipients mr ON m.Id = mr.MessageId AND mr.IsDeleted = FALSE
```

#### **Benefits of This Approach**
1. **Privacy**: Recipients can remove messages from their view without affecting others
2. **Sender Control**: Senders can recall/delete messages for everyone if needed
3. **Audit Trail**: Deletions are logged with timestamps for compliance
4. **Data Integrity**: Messages aren't physically deleted, just hidden from specific users
5. **Flexible Control**: Different levels of deletion based on user role and permissions

#### **Common Deletion Scenarios**
- **Recipient Privacy**: User removes unwanted messages from their inbox
- **Sender Recall**: Sender removes sensitive or incorrect messages for everyone
- **Compliance**: Messages can be hidden while maintaining audit records
- **User Experience**: Clean inbox without affecting other participants

### TypeScript Error Resolution and Message Reappearing Fix
**Problem Identified**: Messages were reappearing after deletion, and TypeScript compilation errors occurred in the MessagingContext.

#### **Issue 1: Messages Coming Back After Deletion**
**Root Cause**: The SSE polling queries were only filtering by `Messages.IsDeleted = FALSE` but not considering `MessageRecipients.IsDeleted = FALSE` for recipient-specific deletions.

**Solution Implemented**: Updated all relevant SSE polling queries to include proper deletion filtering:

**Files Updated**:
- `apps/worker/app/api/harbor/messaging/stream/[tenantId]/route.ts`
- `apps/worker/app/api/harbor/messaging/unread-count/route.ts`

**Query Fixes Applied**:
```sql
-- Before: Only filtered Messages.IsDeleted
LEFT JOIN MessageRecipients mr ON m.Id = mr.MessageId

-- After: Filter both Messages.IsDeleted and MessageRecipients.IsDeleted
LEFT JOIN MessageRecipients mr ON m.Id = mr.MessageId AND mr.IsDeleted = FALSE
```

**Result**: Messages properly disappear from SSE updates when deleted by recipients.

#### **Issue 2: TypeScript Compilation Errors**
**Root Cause**: The `MessagingContext` was using `unknown` types for API responses, causing TypeScript errors:

```
Type error: 'data' is of type 'unknown'.
Type error: 'unreadData' is of type 'unknown'.
```

**Solution Implemented**: Added proper type assertions for API responses:

**File Updated**: `apps/worker/app/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx`

**Type Fixes Applied**:
```typescript
// Before: No type information
const data = await response.json();
const unreadData = await response.json();

// After: Proper type assertions
const data = await response.json() as { 
  unreadCount: number; 
  tenantId: string; 
  tenantName: string; 
  recentUnreadMessages: any[]; 
  timestamp: string 
};

const unreadData = await response.json() as { 
  unreadCount: number; 
  tenantId: string; 
  tenantName: string; 
  recentUnreadMessages: any[]; 
  timestamp: string 
};
```

**Result**: TypeScript compilation errors resolved, proper type safety maintained.

#### **Issue 3: MessagingProvider Context Access Error**
**Problem Identified**: Runtime error `useMessaging must be used within a MessagingProvider` when accessing the messaging context from the appbar.

**Root Cause**: The `MessagingProvider` was only wrapping the main content (`{children}`), but the `HarborAppBar` component (which uses `useMessaging`) was in the header above it.

**Solution Implemented**: Moved the `MessagingProvider` to wrap the entire layout, including the header:

**File Updated**: `apps/worker/app/[lang]/harbor/layout.tsx`

**Layout Fix Applied**:
```tsx
// Before: MessagingProvider only wrapped main content
return (
  <>
    <ScrollRestoration />
    <Flex direction="column" style={{ minHeight: '100vh' }}>
      <Box asChild>
        <header>
          <HarborAppBar lang={lang} /> {/* ❌ No access to MessagingProvider */}
        </header>
      </Box>
      <Box asChild>
        <main>
          <MessagingProvider> {/* ❌ Only wraps main content */}
            {children}
          </MessagingProvider>
        </main>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  </>
);

// After: MessagingProvider wraps entire layout
return (
  <MessagingProvider> {/* ✅ Wraps entire layout */}
    <ScrollRestoration />
    <Flex direction="column" style={{ minHeight: '100vh' }}>
      <Box asChild>
        <header>
          <HarborAppBar lang={lang} /> {/* ✅ Now has access to MessagingProvider */}
        </header>
      </Box>
      <Box asChild>
        <main>
          {children} {/* ✅ Also has access to MessagingProvider */}
        </main>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  </MessagingProvider>
);
```

**Result**: Runtime context error resolved, all components can access the messaging context.

#### **Issue 4: UnreadMessageBadge Visibility**
**Problem Identified**: The unread message count badge was only visible when there were unread messages, making it unclear to users that the messaging system was active.

**Root Cause**: The `UnreadMessageBadge` component was designed to return `null` when `unreadCount === 0`.

**Solution Implemented**: Modified the badge to always show the count, even when it's 0:

**File Updated**: `apps/worker/app/components/harbor/UnreadMessageBadge.tsx`

**Badge Behavior Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before: Only show when there are unread messages
if (error || unreadCount === 0) {
  return null;
}

// After: Always show the badge, even when count is 0
if (error) {
  return null;
}
// Always show the badge, even when count is 0
```

**Badge Styling Enhancement**:
```typescript
// Before: Always red badge
<Badge color="red" size="1">

// After: Different colors based on count
<Badge color={unreadCount > 0 ? "red" : "gray"} size="1">
```

**Tooltip Enhancement**:
```typescript
// Added informative tooltips
title={unreadCount > 0 ? 
  `${unreadCount} unread message${unreadCount === 1 ? '' : 's'}` : 
  'No unread messages'
}
```

**Result**: Users now see both the green dot (connection status) and a gray "0" badge (unread count), making it clear that the messaging system is working but they have no unread messages.

### Redundant API Calls Issue and Solution
**Problem Identified**: Multiple redundant API calls causing performance issues:
- **Multiple SSE Stream Connections**: 3+ connections to `/api/harbor/messaging/stream/default`
- **Excessive Session Checks**: Repeated calls to `/api/auth/session`
- **Aggressive Unread Count Polling**: Multiple instances polling `/api/harbor/messaging/unread-count`

**Root Cause**: The `useUnreadMessageCount` hook was used in 3 different components:
1. `UnreadMessageBadge` - Shows unread count badge
2. `harbor/appbar.tsx` - Shows unread count in navigation
3. `ConnectionStatusIndicator` - Shows connection status

**Solution Implemented**: Singleton SSE connection pattern:
- **Module-level variables**: `globalEventSource`, `globalConnectionCount`, `globalConnectionTenantId`
- **Connection reuse**: Multiple hook instances share the same EventSource connection
- **Smart cleanup**: Connection only closes when no hooks are using it
- **Tenant-aware**: Handles multiple tenants correctly

**Result**: Eliminated redundant connections and reduced API calls by 66%

### Recipient Selection Checkbox Issue and Solution
**Problem Identified**: Recipient selection checkboxes in the messaging interface were not clickable at [https://local-dev.logosophe.com/en/harbor/messaging](https://local-dev.logosophe.com/en/harbor/messaging)

**Root Cause**: Event handling conflicts in the `UnifiedMessageComposer` component:
- **onClick on container**: The `Flex` container had an `onClick` handler that could interfere with checkbox clicks
- **Event propagation**: Checkbox `onChange` events weren't properly isolated
- **Styling conflicts**: Missing explicit `pointerEvents: 'auto'` and `cursor: 'pointer'` styles

**Solution Implemented**: Improved event handling and styling:
- **Separated click handlers**: Removed `onClick` from the container, kept it only on the text
- **Event isolation**: Added `e.stopPropagation()` to checkbox `onChange` events
- **Explicit styling**: Added `cursor: 'pointer'` and `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to ensure clickability
- **Dual interaction**: Users can now click either the checkbox or the email text to select recipients

**Result**: Recipient selection checkboxes are now fully functional and clickable

### Database Schema Fix for MessageRecipients
**Problem Identified**: Database insertion error when sending messages:
```
Error: D1_ERROR: table MessageRecipients has no column named TenantId: SQLITE_ERROR
```

**Root Cause**: Code was trying to insert `TenantId` into `MessageRecipients` table, but that table doesn't have that column.

**Database Structure Analysis** (per `.cursorules` requirement):
- **`Messages` table**: Contains `TenantId` column (one per message)
- **`MessageRecipients` table**: Contains individual recipients (many per message) without `TenantId`
- **Relationship**: `MessageRecipients.MessageId` → `Messages.Id` (foreign key)

**Solution Implemented**: Fixed the INSERT statement in `/api/harbor/messaging/send/route.ts`:
- **Before**: `INSERT INTO MessageRecipients (MessageId, RecipientEmail, TenantId)`
- **After**: `INSERT INTO MessageRecipients (MessageId, RecipientEmail)`
- **Result**: Proper database normalization where tenant context flows from `Messages.TenantId` → `MessageRecipients` through foreign key relationship

**Database Design Pattern**: 
- **Messages**: One record per message with tenant context
- **MessageRecipients**: Many records per message (one per recipient) without duplicating tenant info
- **Tenant Context**: Inherited through `MessageId` foreign key relationship

### UI Cleanup - Redundant Navigation Removal
**Problem Identified**: The appbar contained a redundant "Subscriber Messaging" navigation button that cluttered the interface.

**Root Cause**: The navigation was duplicating functionality already available through the main Harbor interface, creating unnecessary navigation complexity.

**Solution Implemented**: Cleaned up the Harbor appbar navigation:
- **Removed**: Redundant "Subscriber Messaging" navigation button
- **Relocated**: `UnreadMessageBadge` to the connection status area for better visual grouping
- **Result**: Cleaner, more focused navigation that doesn't duplicate Harbor functionality

**Navigation Structure After Cleanup**:
- **Logo**: Links to home page
- **Connection Status**: Shows SSE connection status and unread message count
- **Harbor**: Main Harbor interface (includes messaging)
- **Profile**: User profile management
- **Preferences**: User preferences
- **Sign Out**: Authentication logout

**Benefits**:
- **Cleaner Interface**: Removed redundant navigation items
- **Better UX**: Users access messaging through the main Harbor interface
- **Logical Grouping**: Unread count badge is now grouped with connection status
- **Reduced Clutter**: Simplified navigation structure

### Access Control Fix for Subscriber Messaging
**Problem Identified**: User 303 was getting a 400 error when trying to send messages, even though they had the `subscriber` role.

**Root Cause**: The messaging send API was only checking the `TenantUsers` table for access control, but according to the `.cursorules`, the role resolution should check both `TenantUsers` and `UserRoles` tables.

**User 303 Role Configuration**:
- **`TenantUsers` table**: role `user` (base tenant membership)
- **`UserRoles` table**: role `subscriber` (additional capability)
- **Expected Behavior**: Should have messaging access due to `subscriber` role

**Solution Implemented**: Fixed the access control logic in `/api/harbor/messaging/send/route.ts`:
- **Before**: Only checked `TenantUsers` table for tenant membership
- **After**: Checks both tables following the `.cursorules` pattern:
  1. **System Admin**: Full access to all tenants
  2. **Tenant Admin**: Full access to specific tenant
  3. **Tenant Member**: Access via `TenantUsers` table
  4. **Subscriber**: Access via `UserRoles` table with `subscriber` role

**Access Control Flow**:
```typescript
// Check if user is a tenant admin for this tenant
if (await isTenantAdminFor(userEmail, tenantId)) {
  hasAccess = true;
} else {
  // Check if user is a member of this tenant
  const userTenant = await db.prepare(`
    SELECT 1 FROM TenantUsers 
    WHERE TenantId = ? AND Email = ?
  `).bind(tenantId, userEmail).first();
  
  if (userTenant) {
    hasAccess = true;
  } else {
    // Check if user has subscriber role in UserRoles table for this tenant
    const userRole = await db.prepare(`
      SELECT 1 FROM UserRoles 
      WHERE TenantId = ? AND Email = ? AND RoleId = 'subscriber'
    `).bind(tenantId, userEmail).first();
    
    hasAccess = !!userRole;
  }
}
```

**Result**: User 303 can now successfully send messages using their `subscriber` role from the `UserRoles` table.

### Recipient Validation Fix for Subscriber Messaging
**Problem Identified**: Even after fixing the access control, user 303 was still getting a 400 error when trying to send messages to user 301.

**Root Cause**: The recipient validation logic was only checking the `TenantUsers` table to validate recipients, but user 301 (the recipient) only has the `user` role in `TenantUsers`, not the `subscriber` role.

**User 301 Role Configuration**:
- **`TenantUsers` table**: role `user` (base tenant membership)
- **Expected Behavior**: Should be a valid recipient for subscriber messaging

**Solution Implemented**: Fixed the recipient validation logic in `/api/harbor/messaging/send/route.ts`:
- **Before**: Only checked `TenantUsers` table for recipient validation
- **After**: Checks both tables following the same pattern as access control:
  1. **Tenant Users**: Recipients found in `TenantUsers` table
  2. **Subscribers**: Recipients found in `UserRoles` table with `subscriber` role
  3. **Combined Validation**: Merges results from both tables to create valid recipient list

**Recipient Validation Flow**:
```typescript
// Validate recipients exist in the tenant
const recipientValidation = await db.prepare(`
  SELECT Email FROM TenantUsers 
  WHERE TenantId = ? AND Email IN (${recipients.map(() => '?').join(',')})
`).bind(tenantId, ...recipients).all();

// Also check UserRoles table for subscribers
const subscriberValidation = await db.prepare(`
  SELECT Email FROM UserRoles 
  WHERE TenantId = ? AND Email IN (${recipients.map(() => '?').join(',')}) AND RoleId = 'subscriber'
`).bind(tenantId, ...recipients).all();

// Combine both results
const tenantUsers = recipientValidation.results.map(r => r.Email) as string[];
const subscribers = subscriberValidation.results.map(r => r.Email) as string[];
const validRecipients = [...new Set([...tenantUsers, ...subscribers])];
```

**Result**: User 303 can now successfully send messages to user 301 because the API properly validates recipients from both `TenantUsers` and `UserRoles` tables.

### Missing TenantId Fix for Message Composition
**Problem Identified**: Even after fixing the access control and recipient validation, user 303 was still getting a 400 error: "Missing required fields: subject, body, recipients, tenantId".

**Root Cause (Deep Analysis)**: The issue was **NOT** in the client-side data flow, but in the **page-level tenant resolution**. The `SubscriberMessagingInterface` was receiving `userTenantId` as `undefined` because the page was only checking the `TenantUsers` table.

**Complete Root Cause Chain**:
1. **Page Level**: `page.tsx` only queried `TenantUsers` table for tenant information
2. **User 303 Configuration**: 
   - `TenantUsers`: role `user` (base tenant membership)
   - `UserRoles`: role `subscriber` (additional capability)
3. **Result**: Page couldn't find user 303's tenant, so `userTenantId` was undefined
4. **Component Level**: `UnifiedMessageComposer` received `tenantId={undefined}` as a prop
5. **Data Flow**: `messageData.tenantId` was undefined when passed to `onSend`
6. **API Level**: Request body was missing `tenantId` field entirely
7. **Validation**: API validation failed with "Missing required fields" error

**Solution Implemented**: Fixed the **page-level tenant resolution** to check both tables:

**Before**:
```typescript
// In page.tsx - Only checked TenantUsers table
const userTenantQuery = `
  SELECT tu.TenantId, tu.RoleId, t.Name as TenantName
  FROM TenantUsers tu
  LEFT JOIN Tenants t ON tu.TenantId = t.Id
  WHERE tu.Email = ?
`;

const userTenantResult = await db.prepare(userTenantQuery)
  .bind(session.user.email)
  .first() as any;

if (!userTenantResult?.TenantId) {
  redirect(`/${lang}/harbor`); // ❌ User 303 redirected away
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// In page.tsx - Check both TenantUsers and UserRoles tables
let userTenantId: string;
let userTenantName: string;

if (userTenantResult?.TenantId) {
  // User found in TenantUsers table
  userTenantId = userTenantResult.TenantId;
  userTenantName = userTenantResult.TenantName || userTenantId;
} else {
  // Check UserRoles table for subscriber role
  const userRoleQuery = `
    SELECT ur.TenantId, t.Name as TenantName
    FROM UserRoles ur
    LEFT JOIN Tenants t ON ur.TenantId = t.Id
    WHERE ur.Email = ? AND ur.RoleId = 'subscriber'
  `;
  
  const userRoleResult = await db.prepare(userRoleQuery)
    .bind(session.user.email)
    .first() as any;
  
  if (userRoleResult?.TenantId) {
    userTenantId = userRoleResult.TenantId;
    userTenantName = userRoleResult.TenantName || userTenantId;
  } else {
    redirect(`/${lang}/harbor`);
  }
}
```

**Complete Data Flow Fix**:
1. **Page Level**: Now correctly resolves tenant from both `TenantUsers` and `UserRoles` tables
2. **Component Level**: `UnifiedMessageComposer` receives correct `tenantId` prop
3. **Data Flow**: `messageData.tenantId` contains the correct tenant ID
4. **API Level**: Request body includes all required fields including `tenantId`
5. **Validation**: API validation passes successfully

**Result**: The API now receives all required fields including `tenantId`, allowing proper validation and message processing.

**Key Lessons**:
1. **Always trace the complete data flow** from page → component → API
2. **Check both tables** when resolving user roles and tenant access
3. **The issue can be upstream** from where the error appears
4. **Systematic debugging** with comprehensive logging reveals the true root cause

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Parameter Order**: Access control functions expect `(userEmail, db)` not `(db, userEmail)`
2. **Column Names**: Database uses `MediaId` not `MediaFileId`, `R2Key` not `FileKey`
3. **Type Safety**: Always type database query results explicitly with `as string`, `as number`
4. **Table Relationships**: MessageRecipients doesn't have TenantId - it comes from Messages table
5. **Next.js Route Exports**: Don't export non-route functions from route files

### Best Practices Established
1. **Query First**: Always check actual database schema before implementing
2. **Type Everything**: Use explicit type assertions for database properties
3. **Separate Concerns**: Keep SSE broadcasting functions in separate files
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Use same access control patterns across all routes
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper null checks and error handling

## User Blocking System Implementation

### Overview
The messaging system implements a sophisticated **two-tier blocking system** that provides comprehensive user control and administrative oversight:

1. **System-wide Blocks** (Admin-controlled): Global blocks that override all personal blocks
2. **Personal Blocks** (User-controlled): Individual user blocks that create mutual isolation

### Blocking System Design

#### **System-wide Blocking (Admin)**
- **Scope**: Global system-wide blocks that affect all users
- **Control**: Only global system admins can create system-wide blocks
- **Override**: System-wide blocks take precedence over personal blocks
- **Persistence**: Blocks remain active until explicitly removed by admin
- **Audit**: All system-wide blocks are logged with admin information

#### **Personal Blocking (Harbor Users)**
- **Scope**: Individual user blocks within their tenant
- **Control**: Any Harbor user can block other users in their tenant
- **Mutual Isolation**: When User A blocks User B, both users are isolated from each other
- **Tenant Scoped**: Personal blocks only apply within the user's tenant
- **Self-Management**: Users can unblock users they previously blocked

### Database Schema for Blocking

#### **UserBlocks Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UserBlocks (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    BlockerEmail TEXT NOT NULL,
    BlockedEmail TEXT NOT NULL,
    IsActive BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    DeletedAt DATETIME,
    DeletedBy TEXT,
    UNIQUE(BlockerEmail, BlockedEmail)
);
```

#### **Blocking Logic Implementation**
```sql
-- Check if user is blocked (system-wide or personal)
SELECT 1 FROM UserBlocks 
WHERE (BlockedEmail = ? OR BlockerEmail = ?) 
AND IsActive = TRUE
AND (
    -- System-wide blocks (from admin users)
    BlockerEmail IN (SELECT Email FROM Credentials WHERE Role IN ('admin', 'tenant'))
    OR
    -- Personal blocks (from regular users)
    BlockerEmail NOT IN (SELECT Email FROM Credentials WHERE Role IN ('admin', 'tenant'))
);
```

### Blocking System Features

#### **Message Sending Restrictions**
- **Blocked Users Cannot Send**: Users who are blocked cannot send messages to anyone
- **Cannot Send to Blocked Users**: Users cannot send messages to users they have blocked
- **System-wide Override**: System-wide blocks prevent all communication with blocked users
- **Tenant Isolation**: Personal blocks only apply within the user's tenant

#### **Message Display Restrictions**
- **Hidden Messages**: Messages from/to blocked users are hidden from message lists
- **SSE Filtering**: Real-time updates respect blocking status
- **Unread Count**: Blocked messages don't contribute to unread counts
- **Search Results**: Blocked users don't appear in message search results

#### **Recipient Selection UI**
- **Visual Indicators**: Blocked users show "ADMIN BLOCKED" or "USER BLOCKED" badges
- **Disabled Selection**: Blocked users cannot be selected as message recipients
- **Clear Feedback**: Users understand why certain recipients are unavailable
- **Blocked Count**: Interface shows count of blocked vs. available recipients

### Blocking System API Endpoints

#### **Harbor Blocking APIs** (`/api/harbor/messaging/blocks/*`)
- **GET** `/api/harbor/messaging/blocks` - List user's personal blocks
- **POST** `/api/harbor/messaging/blocks` - Create new personal block
- **DELETE** `/api/harbor/messaging/blocks/[id]` - Remove personal block
- **GET** `/api/harbor/messaging/recipients` - List available recipients for blocking

#### **Dashboard Blocking APIs** (`/api/dashboard/messaging/blocks/*`)
- **GET** `/api/dashboard/messaging/blocks` - List all blocks (admin view)
- **POST** `/api/dashboard/messaging/blocks` - Create system-wide block
- **DELETE** `/api/dashboard/messaging/blocks/[id]` - Remove system-wide block

### Blocking System UI Components

#### **Harbor Blocking Interface**
- **Blocked Users Page**: Dedicated page at `/[lang]/harbor/messaging/blocks`
- **Block Management**: Search, block, and unblock users
- **Block History**: View all blocks created by the user
- **User Search**: Find users to block by email or name
- **Block Confirmation**: Clear warnings about blocking consequences

#### **Dashboard Blocking Interface**
- **System-wide Block Management**: Admin interface for global blocks
- **User Block Overview**: View all blocks across the system
- **Block Analytics**: Statistics on blocking patterns
- **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple blocks efficiently

#### **Message Composition Integration**
- **Recipient Filtering**: Blocked users appear but are unselectable
- **Blocked Badges**: Clear visual indicators for blocked status
- **Recipient Counts**: Show available vs. blocked recipient counts
- **Smart Selection**: "Select All" only selects non-blocked users

### Blocking System Security

#### **Access Control**
- **System-wide Blocks**: Only global system admins can create
- **Personal Blocks**: Users can only block users in their own tenant
- **Block Removal**: Users can only remove blocks they created
- **Admin Override**: System admins can remove any block

#### **Data Protection**
- **Tenant Isolation**: Blocks don't cross tenant boundaries
- **Audit Logging**: All blocking actions are logged with timestamps
- **Soft Deletion**: Blocks are soft-deleted for audit purposes
- **Role Validation**: Blocking operations validate user roles and permissions

### Blocking System Integration

#### **SSE Stream Filtering**
```typescript
// Filter out messages from/to blocked users in SSE streams
const baseQuery = `
  SELECT m.*, ... 
  FROM Messages m
  WHERE m.TenantId = ? 
  AND m.IsDeleted = FALSE
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM UserBlocks ub 
    WHERE ub.IsActive = TRUE
    AND (
      (ub.BlockedEmail = ? AND ub.BlockerEmail IN (
        SELECT Email FROM Credentials WHERE Role IN ('admin', 'tenant')
      ))
      OR
      (ub.BlockerEmail = ? AND ub.BlockedEmail IN (
        SELECT Email FROM Credentials WHERE Role IN ('admin', 'tenant')
      ))
      OR
      (ub.BlockedEmail = ? AND ub.BlockerEmail = ?)
      OR
      (ub.BlockerEmail = ? AND ub.BlockedEmail = ?)
    )
  )
`;
```

#### **Message Sending Validation**
```typescript
// Prevent blocked users from sending messages
const senderBlocked = await isUserBlockedInTenant(userEmail, tenantId);
if (senderBlocked) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({
    success: false,
    error: 'You are blocked from sending messages in this tenant'
  }), { status: 403 });
}

// Prevent sending to blocked users
for (const recipient of recipients) {
  const isBlocked = await isUserBlocked(userEmail, recipient, db);
  if (isBlocked) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({
      success: false,
      error: `Cannot send message to blocked user: ${recipient}`
    }), { status: 400 });
  }
}
```

#### **Recipient List Filtering**
```typescript
// Show blocked users but mark them as unselectable
const recipientsWithBlockStatus = await Promise.all(
  allRecipients.map(async (recipient) => {
    const isBlocked = await isUserBlocked(userEmail, recipient.Email, db);
    const blockerEmail = await getBlockerEmail(userEmail, recipient.Email, db);
    
    return {
      ...recipient,
      IsBlocked: isBlocked,
      BlockerEmail: blockerEmail
    };
  })
);
```
